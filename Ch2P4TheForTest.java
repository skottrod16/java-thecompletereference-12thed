/*
 Simplest form of the for loop:
    for(initialization; condition; iternation) statement;
    -the initialization portion of the loop sets a loop control variable to an initial value. 
    -the condition is a Boolean expression that tests the loop control variable. 
    -if the outcome of the test is true, 'statement' executes and the for loops continues to iterate. 
    -if it is false, the loop terminates. 
    -the iteration expression determines how the loop control variable is changed each time the loop iterates.
